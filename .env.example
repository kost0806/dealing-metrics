# ========================================
# Firebase Admin SDK (Server-Side Only)
# ========================================
# These credentials are NEVER exposed to the client
# Choose ONE of the following methods:

# Method 1: Service Account File (Recommended for Development)
# Download from Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
# Place the JSON file in project root and add to .gitignore
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=./serviceAccountKey.json

# Method 2: Environment Variables (Recommended for Production/Vercel)
# Get these from your service account JSON file
FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your_project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour private key here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

# ========================================
# SECURITY NOTES
# ========================================
# 1. NEVER use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for Firebase credentials
# 2. Service account key file must be in .gitignore
# 3. For Vercel deployment, use Method 2 (environment variables)
# 4. Private key must be in quotes and preserve \n line breaks
# 5. Client never accesses Firebase directly - only through API routes
